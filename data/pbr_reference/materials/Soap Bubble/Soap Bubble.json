    "description": "The colors of a soap bubble are the result of an interaction between the light reflected from the front and back surfaces of the soap film, a phenomenon known as thin-film interference. The thickness of a soap bubble can range between 10 nm and 1000 nm. It's thinner at the top due to gravity.",
