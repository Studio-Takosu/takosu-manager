    "description": "Modern car paints are nearly always an acrylic polyurethane \"enamel\" with a pigmented basecoat and a clear topcoat. It may be described as \"acrylic\", \"acrylic enamel\", \"urethane\", etc. and the clearcoat in particular may be described as a lacquer. The size of the metal flakes in metallic paints is typically between 100 to 400 microns in diameter. Modern automobile paint is applied in several layers, with a total thickness of around 100 \u00ce\u00bcm (0.1mm).",
